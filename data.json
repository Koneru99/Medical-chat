Specifically, the investigators propose to evaluate the following:\n\n1. Image acquisition time using traditional 2D and new 4D processing techniques;\n2. Image quality for 2D and 4D processing techniques subjectively\n3. Post-processing time for the two techniques.\n4. Correlation of overall Left ventricular and right ventricular volumes and functions and aortic and pulmonic flow studies using the two techniques.\n5. The study will monitor any changes in patient diagnoses or treatment resulting from any differences in interpretations between the two processes.","detailedDescription":"Traditional scanning and post-processing of 2D Cardiac Magnetic Resonance images (CMRI) is highly technical and time consuming, with many exams requiring one to two hours to complete. In addition, performance of 2D scans often requires expert technologists working closely with the clinician imaging expert. These factors limit the general clinical utility of current generation cardiac MRI.\n\nIn order to address these factors, many researchers began to explore the use of 4D image acquisition and post processing to shorten exam time. These researchers have documented success at these efforts but, to the best of the current investigators' knowledge, such advanced imaging acquisition and post-processing systems are not readily commercially available in the US.\n\nRecently GE teamed with Vios-Works for MRI to provide a cloud-based visualization platform for 4D MRI that provides quantitative and structured reporting in the post processing environment that makes use of advance MR imaging acquisition techniques. The images can be accessed by the interpreter and reviewed and manipulated in order to assess cardiac function and flow retrospectively, which, prior to this innovation, only has been available for computed tomography (CT) generated images.\n\nThis investigative team hypothesizes that the use of 4D imaging will result in reduced time for acquisition (approximately 6 minutes as opposed to 1 hour), and improvement of diagnostic capability.\n\nImages will be acquired using the current standard 2D acquisition protocol for routine clinical cardiac MRI. A repeat acquisition will be completed using the new protocol for 4D imaging acquisition. This will require that patient exams be extended in length by six minutes for those enrolled in the study. The investigators will evaluate the image quality of the two techniques and grade them according to a scale of 1 to 3 with 1 being excellent cardiac borders easily identified; 2 - acceptable: cardiac borders acceptably identified; and 3, non-diagnostic. The investigators will specifically focus on the evaluation of cardiac function of both right and left ventricular function as well as flow analysis of both the aortic and pulmonic valves.\n\nFor each method, technician time and MD time will be collected. The exam will go through post processing for standard 2D, following by the new 4D post processing technique. Time for post processing will be collected. All subjects who agree will receive both a 2D and a 4D MRI. The investigators will evaluate inter and intra reader reliability by having all readers read the first 15 exams, and then read them a second time after two weeks in a different order Readers showing variation in performance will be retrained on interpretation of 4D MRI before reading scans for the study.\n\nOnce readers have been trained, the study will require that all 2D and 4D exams be read by two readers. The exams will be assigned randomly to readers using the Biostatistician Office random assignment services."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cardiac Disease"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Each participant will receive tradition 2D Cardiac imaging as ordered per standard of care.

Tumors have a complex vascular network which is likely affected by the global changes in hemodynamics and perfusion that occur during moderate exercise. Increased tumor oxygenation is clinically relevant as it may counteract the hypoxic tumor environment which is known to contribute to resistance to chemo- and radiation therapies, angiogenesis, invasiveness and metastasis, genomic instability, and resistance to cell death.\n\nThe researcher can use noninvasive optical imaging technology called diffuse optical spectroscopy to safely and non-invasively quantify the dynamics of blood flow and metabolism in tumors and normal tissue of subjects undergoing supervised cycling exercise.

This study will also help us understand the biological reason for how DOSI works.","detailedDescription":"There is considerable interest in developing imaging protocols to monitor and predict breast cancer response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), which is chemotherapy given before surgical removal of the tumor, both prior to and as early as possible during the course of treatment. The efficacy and practicality of conventional imaging approaches in the NAC setting varies and identifies the need for alternate functional imaging strategies. Diffuse optical spectroscopic imaging (DOSI) is an experimental imaging method that allows patients to be followed before and during treatment with a cost-effective, bedside, handheld scanning probe. DOSI is a non-invasive technology developed at the University of California, Irvine Beckman Laser Institute. Studies will be performed at seven clinical sites on approximately 200 suspected breast cancer patients, of which 150 are expected to undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC).\n\nAs a primary aim, the investigators will evaluate whether DOSI can predict NAC pathologic complete response (pCR), which is defined as no tumor cell left in the resected tissue at surgery) by the mid-point of the therapy regimen. As non-invasive DOSI is obtained rapidly with no risk/discomfort, this experimental imaging modality could be used as an indicator of pathologic response which has been an established indicator of long-term survival. The investigators long-term goal is to provide oncologists with a relatively simple, risk-free bedside tool that can be used to help inform medical decisions on chemotherapy regimen, duration, and timing of surgery, thereby maximizing therapeutic response and minimizing unnecessary toxicity."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Breast Tumor"],"keywords":["Neoadjuvant Therapy","Diffuse Optical Spectroscopic Imaging","DOSI","Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":0,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"DOSI","type":"OTHER","interventionNames":["Device: DOSI"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"DOSI","description":"Breast tissue properties scanning","armGroupLabels":["DOSI"],"otherNames":["Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Concentration of oxy-hemoglobin (HbO2), in blood.","timeFrame":"through study completion, an average of 3 years"},{"measure":"Concentration of deoxy-hemoglobin (HHb) in blood.","timeFrame":"through study completion, an average of 3 years"},{"measure":"Concentration of total hemoglobin in blood.","timeFrame":"through study completion, an average of 3 years"},{"measure":"Water content of tissue (%)","timeFrame":"through study completion, an average of 3 years"},{"measure":"Bulk lipid in tissue (%)","timeFrame":"through study completion, an average of 3 years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Females between the ages of 21 and 80.

It will take 15 minutes. They will provide their COVID-19 test results and medical records.\n\nParticipants will complete a second telephone interview. It will take 30 60 minutes. They will also take online surveys every 3 months for 3 years.\n\nThe interview and surveys will ask participants about their health before they got COVID-19, what happened while they had COVID-19, and what their recovery has been like.\n\nParticipants will get log-in data to take the online surveys. Completing all of the surveys the first time may take up to 3 hours. Follow-up surveys will take up to 30 minutes. Participants do not have to complete the surveys in one sitting. They will be able to save their progress and finish the surveys later.\n\nParticipants may be contacted to take part in other research studies.","detailedDescription":"Study Description:\n\nIn late 2019, the novel coronavirus SARS/CoV2 appeared in Wuhan, China. The various ways that humans will recover from COVID-19 is just starting to be observed and it is clear there will be a wide range of convalescent experiences. A year into the pandemic, the post-acute sequelae of SARS/CoV2 infection (PASC) is known to be common and includes a broad range of symptoms and potential pathologies. This phased protocol is designed to observe and study the convalescence and recoveries from acute SARS/CoV2 infections.\n\nPhase A Phase A Surveying (Phase A) will enable people in the community that are convalescing from COVID-19 to be studied using telephone interviews and internet-based questionnaires. The objective of Phase A Surveying is to observe and describe the range of medical syndromes that occur in the wake of an acute SARS/CoV2 infection.\n\nParticipants are required to be within the first five years of their recovery and have documentation of a positive laboratory test for COVID-19. Additional cohorts of persons with neurological sequelae, persons with a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 with negative testing, persons with adverse complications after COVID 19 vaccination and participants co-enrolled in other research studies within the Division of Intramural Research will also be studied. The data collected during Phase A will describe the range of symptoms and patterns of symptom clustering of PASC. This data will also characterize the patient populations which have been or will be evaluated at the NIH Clinical Center in more detail.\n\nPhase B Evaluation (Phase B) will allow surveyed participants of research interest from Phase A to be invited to the NIH Clinical Center for a medical evaluation and to undergo a panel of standard research measurements. Each participant will be medically and psychologically characterized to best understand if their complaints can be attributed to known disorders. The observations made during Phase B will provide insights into the range, character, and subtypes of PASC. Individuals found to have disorders being studied within the Division of Intermural Research at NIH will be appropriately referred.\n\nEvaluated individuals with persistent symptoms in the absence of other demonstrable medical disease and individuals who fully recovered from a confirmed SARS/CoV2 infection will be invited back to the NIH Clinical Center for broad and deep research measurements.\n\nPhase C Deep Phenotyping (Phase C) will be synchronized with other NIH-approved deep phenotyping protocols to foster cross-phenotype comparison research with other medical syndromes, such as Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) and Gulf War Illness (GWI). Deep phenotyping characterizations would be used to generate scientific hypotheses for testing in future studies and for cross-comparisons with other fatiguing disorders.\n\nPrevious epidemics have created unique medical syndromes in the past. Data from this protocol may be used to characterize PASC and any Post-COVID 19 Syndrome subtypes that may be discovered. If warranted, a Criteria Development phase will develop data-driven research consensus criteria for defining PASC and any Post-COVID 19 Syndromes.\n\nThe results of this protocol will provide novel insights into COVID-19 convalescence and its potential outcomes.\n\nThis current version of the protocol provides the details for Phase A, Phase B, and Phase C. Additional phases will be detailed in planned protocol amendments.\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary Objective:\n\nPhase A: To observe and describe the range of medical syndromes that occur in the wake of acute SARS/CoV2 infection.\n\nPhase B: To describe and medically characterize patients with PASC and those who fully recovered from SARS/CoV2 infection.\n\nPhase C: To compare the clinical and biological phenotypes between persons with unexplained PASC and those who fully recovered from SARS/CoV2 infection.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\nPhase A:\n\n* To observe and describe recovery trajectories following an acute SARS/CoV2 infection.\n* To observe and describe the range of medical syndromes and recovery trajectories of participants who report adverse effects after COVID-19 vaccination\n* To compare the range of medical syndromes and recovery trajectories of participants with a confirmed SARS/CoV2 infection to other cohorts, such as participants who have a medically confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation and participants who report adverse complications after COVID-19 vaccination.\n\nPhase B:\n\n* To determine the relations between acute SARS/CoV2 severity, subjective functional impairment, and objective functional performance.\n* To explore the pathophysiology of PASC and its subtypes.\n\nPhase C:\n\n* To compare the clinical and biological phenotypes between persons with PASC to historic data and samples collected on persons with post-infectious Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, and veterans with Gulf War Illness.\n* To explore the pathophysiology of fatigue and post-exertional malaise in PASC. Fatigue will be explored using tasks designed to create muscular and cognitive fatigue. Post-exertional malaise will be explored using an exercise stress test and measuring the symptomatic and biological changes.\n\nEndpoints:\n\nOutcome measures\n\nPhase A: The number and severity of persistent symptoms associated with COVID-19 convalescence. Collected data will be used to characterize different narratives of COVID-19 convalescence.\n\nPhase B: Collected data and samples for use to perform exploratory analyses for the generation of new hypotheses regarding PASC.\n\nPhase C: Identification of hypothetical mechanisms of PASC using collected data and samples. The types of analyses to be performed will be wide ranging. Planned exploratory areas of focus may include:\n\n1. Immune system and inflammatory signaling characterization in at baseline and following maximal exercise exertion using flow cytometry, RNA sequencing, multiplex immunochemical analysis, NK cell functional analysis.\n2. Microbiome characterization at baseline and following maximal exercise exertion using shotgun metagenomics.\n3. Bioenergetics, autonomic, and metabolic characterization using mitochondrial plasmid genotyping, pulmonary spirometry, gas exchange measurements during exercise, metabolic chamber measurements of total body energy use, metabolomic analysis of stool, mitochondrion proteomics and metabolomics from muscle, and functional respiration of PBMCs using extracellular flux mito stress assay.\n4.

It works effectively and efficiently until inflammation disturbs its functioning. Once compromised by inflammation, the immune system loses its capacity to recognize antigens and dependably defend the body against disease and illness.\n\nWhen COVID-19 invades humans, it causes an immune-storm (cytokine-storm) that can directly damage the organ(s), leading to death. The virus is an antigen - a trigger - but it is not the actual reason that causes organ failure and death; instead, it is the body's over immune reaction that is the cause. In attempting to protect the body, the immune system overreacts to the antigen, which includes the infected cells, which causes a cytokine-storm, and the subsequent and rapid shut down of the infected individual's organ(s)' structure, leaving the body without sufficient strength or time to fight back. When the medical herbs join the body, it can slow down the immune reaction. Medical herbs benefit the physical body; they protect the cells and organism structure and mediate the immune response, allowing the T cells to kill the virus (mutated or not) internally. Such success has been achieved by the All Natural Medicine Clinic during pre-clinical trials.\n\nThis clinical study's goal is to demonstrate that the immune system can be rebuilt and retrained, using natural medicine (i.e., medical herbs), to kill the virus without causing the immune storm, and to explore the mechanism by which these medical herbs, which have been used for thousands of years for healing, achieve results.","detailedDescription":"According to CDC data, as of January 30, 2021, 25,780,144 individuals residing in the United States had been infected by COVID-19 and 435,151 had died as a result of the disease. No drug has yet been identified that explicitly kills the COVID-19 virus. While various vaccines have been developed to prevent infection, the virus continues to mutate, and scientific research remains behind the virus trajectory.\n\nThe human immune system, when functioning properly, can prevent the body from succumbing to infections from external sources and from internal cell mutations, including the COVID-19 virus and cancer cells. That is, the defense system comes from nature. This clinical study proves that the immune system can respond to those antigens and kill them if the immune system is given a chance. However, the human immune system can become compromised through inflammation and subsequently unable to successfully prevent infection and cancer.\n\nWhen COVID-19 invades humans, it causes an immune-storm (cytokine-storm) that can directly damage the organ(s), leading to death. The virus is an antigen - a trigger - but it is not the actual reason that causes organ failure and death; instead, it is the body's over-immune reaction that is the cause. In attempting to protect the body, the immune system overreacts to the antigen, which includes the infected cells, which causes a cytokine-storm, and the subsequent and rapid shut down of the infected individual's organ(s)' structure, leaving the body without sufficient strength or time to fight back.\n\nMedical herbs can mediate the immunity disorder caused by infections, and mutated cells, including COVID-19 and its mutations. Our pre-clinical study found that the medical herbs inhibit the inflammation expression, reduce the chance of cytokine-storm, prevent deterioration, and reduce the mortality rate. In addition, the T cells can perform their job when the inflammation is under control. The virus and cancer cells belong to antigens that should be killed by natural killer (NK) cells and T cells. This clinical study aims not to provide drugs to kill the antigens, but rather to create the necessary conditions inside the human body to allow the immune system a chance to overcome the antigens. The clinic has used this treatment concept to successfully treat infected patients and cancer patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Covid19 Virus Infection"],"keywords":["Medicinal Herbs","Virus","COVID-19","Coronavirus Disease 2019","Infections","Inflammation","Immunity","Metabolite","clots","thrombus","Viral Pneumonia","Fever","Cough","Chest congestion"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"The participants are randomly divided into two groups: the treatment group and the control group.
